# Goaly

We understand that change is difficult considering our multiple demands.  We believe, however, that support and accountability can really make a difference in helping us achieve the goals we may have.  This is why we created <em><strong>Goaly</strong></em>.

<em><strong>Goaly</strong></em>'s mission is to provide a platform for:
<ul>
  <li> guided goal-setting </li>
  <li> progress-tracking </li>
  <li> support
    <ul>
      <li> social network </li>
      <li> information </li>
      <li> reminders </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
We believe that anybody willing to make a change can benefit from this application!  Its social feature makes it ideal for goal-setting at both the individual and at the group level.
